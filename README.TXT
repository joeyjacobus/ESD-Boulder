To install this package:

From DOS/Command prompt
   - Select the drive containing the distribution.
   - CD to the subdirectory containing the distribution (if necessary)
   - Run the INSTALL program

From Windows:
   - From "My Computer", open the drive containing the distribution.
   - Locate and open the subdirectory containing the distribution.
   - Double-Click on the INSTALL program icon.

NOTE: INSTALL is menu driven, and allows you to choose what portions of
the distribution package to install, and where to put them (directory).
It will warn you before installing over an existing directory, and does
not modify AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS. It simply copies/dearchives the
files from the distribution diskette into appropriate directories on your
hard disk.

Please refer to the various README.*, *.TXT, and *.DOC files installed
with the package for more information.

Note that some DDS source files ('.c', '.h' etc.) are written using tab
stops at 4 character intervals, which is much more convenient for 'C'
development than the usual MS-DOS tab stops at 8 character intervals.
The DDSIDE and EDT editors from Dunfield Development Systems correctly
support these 4 character tab stop.

For information on obtaining technical help, see the TECHSUPP.TXT file
installed with the package documentation.

EMILY52: A PC based 8051/52 Simulator / Emulator

    A software simulator/emulator for the Intel 8051/8052 series of
    microcontrollers. EMILY features an easy to use "windowed" user
    interface, and is capable of simulating at better than  500,000
    instructions per second on a 486/33mhz PC.
    - Supports full 64K of PROGRAM and 64K of DATA memory. DATA and PROGRAM
      memory may also be overlaid into a single 64K address space.
    - Optionally interfaces with a Resident Control Program (supplied) on
      your target system which allows you to include the physical I/O lines,
      timers, serial port etc. in your simulation.
    - Single step, Multi Step, Animate and High Speed execution modes,
      with 4095 instruction traceback recorder in all modes.
    - Simultaneous on-screen displays of program disassembly, internal
      memory, CPU registers and simulation messages.
    - Full screen editors for CPU registers, Special Function Registers
      (SFR's), and each of the INTERNAL, EXTERNAL DATA and PROGRAM memory
      spaces. All of the above may be viewed/altered at any time during the
      debugging session.
    - Multiple breakpoints are transparent to the user program.
    - Supports the additional SFR's and internal RAM of the 8052 series,
      and is user configurable for additional SFR's of expanded chips.
    - Serial I/O in a window on the screen, or redirected to a PC COMM port.
    - Includes MONICA52, a PC hosted monitor program for ON-BOARD debugging,
      with a user interface that's virtually identical to EMILY52.
    - Supports single-chip in-circuit emulation using DS5000 CPU.
    - Many more features.
    - INCLUDES EMILY320 - As above for Dallas 80C320/520
S/N: DEMO installed August 24, 2016 (Not to be used after 30 days).
