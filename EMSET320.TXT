A program for configuring EMILY and MONICA :

EMSET320 is a program which configures the EMILY and/or MONICA  programs
to set the initial values of several features which are loaded when  the
program is run.

The EMSET320 command accepts the name of the  file  to  configure  as  a
command line argument.  If  no  extension  is  given,  EMSET320  assumed
".COM". For example, to edit the settings contained in EMILY320.COM, you
could use the command:

                        EMSET320 EMILY320.COM
                                  or
                          EMSET320 EMILY320

If additional filenames are given,  EMSET320 will write the new settings
to those files (as well as the original one).  This behavior can be used
to copy settings from one file to another:

                      EMSET320 EMILY320 MONIC320

The above command reads the default settings from  EMILY320.COM,  allows
you to edit them,  and writes  the  new  settings  to  EMILY320.COM  and
MONIC320.COM.  If you do not make any changes before exiting and  saving
the settings,  the effect is to copy the settings from  EMILY320.COM  to
MONIC320.COM.

Once you have started EMSET320,  you will be presented with  a  menu  of
configuration options which can be configured:

                       Screen colors
                       Special function registers
                       Serial I/O defaults
                       Target interface speed
                       Serial port assignments
                       Animate/Breakpoint delays
                       RESET logic level
                       Default load filename
                       Exit EMSET320
Screen colors:

   This option permits you to change the  colors  used  in  the  various
   windows presented by EMILY and MONICA.  NOTE:  Only the color screens
   can be altered.  When the  '/Monochrome'  switch is used,  EMILY  and
   MONICA always use a black and white presentation.

   Once you select this option,  you will be  presented  with  a  sample
   window which is displayed in the colors of the  "Disassembly"  window
   in EMILY and MONICA. Press:

        PgUp/PgDn   - To switch to the other windows
        Up/Down     - To change the foreground color
        Left/Right  - To change the background color
        Escape      - To return to the main EMSET320 menu

Special function registers:

   This  option  allows  you  to  Add/Modify/Delete   special   function
   registers which appear in the EMILY/MONICA 'F'  menu and disassembler
   output.

   The currently defined special function registers will  be  displayed,
   along with each ones address.  To  change/delete/insert  a  register,
   press the letter beside the one you wish to alter.  If  more  than  1
   column of registers are defined,  use the  SPACE  BAR  to  shift  the
   selection menu between each row of register definitions.

   Once you have selected a register,  you will be presented with a menu
   of options:

        Change address      - Modify the Direct Address of the SFR
        Delete entry        - Delete the SFR definition
        Insert before       - Insert a new definition before this one
        Insert after        - Insert a new definition after this one

   NOTE: if you add SFR's to MONICA,  or to EMILY when you are using the
   '/Hardware'  option,  you  must  also  add   code   to   the   kernal
   (KERNL320.ASM) to allow them to be read and written.  The kernal uses
   a "jump" table of direct addresses  (called 'CTAB1'  and 'CTAB2')  to
   invoke handlers which read and write those addresses in  response  to
   commands from the PC.  Look at the code for other SFR's  ('TL0' etc.)
   to see how to add your own handlers.

   When you run EMILY or MONICA with additional SFR's defined,  use  the
   SPACE BAR to move the selection menu between each row of SFR's.

Serial I/O defaults:

   This option presents you with a serial I/O setup screen which  mimics
   the ones in EMILY and MONICA.  Select the values that you wish to  be
   in effect when EMILY and/or MONICA is loaded.
Target interface speed:

   This option sets the serial I/O speed  (baudrate)  that  is  used  by
   MONICA and EMILY  (when  '/h'  is used)  to interface to  the  target
   system kernal.  You should not change this  value,  unless  you  have
   modified KERNL320.ASM,  or are using a target crystal frequency which
   is  not  11.059  Mhz.  The  KERNL320.ASM  file  contains  a  detailed
   discussion  on  interface  speeds  available   at   various   crystal
   frequencies.  Use the UP/DOWN arrows to change the  interface  speed,
   ESCAPE to exit.

Serial port assignments:

   This option allows you to select the PC serial ports  which  will  be
   used for the Serial I/O redirection and Target  interface  functions.
   Use the 'S' and 'T'  keys to cycle each option from COM1-COM4.  Press
   ESCAPE to exit.  NOTE:  You cannot define both functions as the  same
   serial port.

Animate/Breakpoint delays:

   This options allows  you  to  change  the  default  delay  value  (in
   milliseconds)  of  the  animation  single-step  function,   and   the
   breakpoint delay timer. NOTE that due to a PC clock limitation, these
   delays are limited to a resolution of 1/18 second (about 55 ms).

RESET logic level:

   This option allows you to set the logic  level  of  the  RTS  "reset"
   control line from the PC. You may select RESET when RTS is "asserted"
   (+12v) or "deasserted" (-12v).

Default load filename

   This option allows you to select the default filename  and  extension
   that will appear in the input area in response to a  'L'oad  command.
   Enter the name you wish, and press ENTER or ESCAPE to exit.

   NOTE: EMSET320 should NOT be used on the DEMO version of EMILY.
S/N: DEMO installed August 24, 2016 (Not to be used after 30 days).
